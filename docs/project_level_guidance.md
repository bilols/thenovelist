## Universal Rules (read before EVERY response)

1. **Always consult the latest `requirements_digest.md`.**  
   Never contradict or omit a requirement.

2. **Full‑file delivery only.**  
   When supplying source, return complete, self‑contained files ready for copy‑replace—no snippets or inline patches.

3. **Touch only the files directly related to the explicitly requested feature or fix.**  
   Unrelated code must remain byte‑for‑byte identical.

4. **State “Digest reviewed” at the top of every technical reply** to confirm you reread the digest.

5. **Ask clarifying questions** when doubt exists; do not guess and silently proceed.
