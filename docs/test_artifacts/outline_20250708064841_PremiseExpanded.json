  "premise": "A quiet, unremarkable apartment building for seniors hires a carpenter to renovate a vacant unit.\nThe job seems simple, but the residents are anything but ordinary—especially one who claims he's \"been here forever.\" After weeks on the job, the carpenter discovers an old, warped wooden door in a hallway under renovation. He’s certain it wasn’t there before. When others brush it off, he investigates on his own. Inside, he finds something impossible: the door leads to moments from his past. At first, he’s enchanted by the chance to revisit old memories.\nBut when darker chapters emerge, he’s forced to confront painful truths he’d buried. Then the door vanishes. Locked out, he’s left changed—and unknowingly replaced. A new carpenter arrives to take on the same job. In the building now lives a mysterious new resident: an old man with his name.\nThe cycle quietly resets.",

  "premiseExpanded": "The quiet, unremarkable apartment building for seniors becomes a labyrinth of mystery when a carpenter is hired to renovate a vacant unit. His task seems straightforward, but the eccentric residents, particularly one cryptic figure claiming eternal residence, suggest otherwise. As weeks pass, the carpenter stumbles upon an old, warped wooden door in a hallway under renovation, certain it materialized overnight. Curiosity piqued, he finds the door leading to pivotal moments from his past. Enchanted, he delves into cherished memories, but the door soon reveals darker chapters he had long suppressed, forcing him to confront painful truths and unresolved guilt. As he grapples with these revelations, the door disappears, leaving him trapped in a present altered by his past. Unbeknownst to him, the building has exacted its toll: he has been subtly erased from his own life. A new carpenter arrives, assuming his role, while an enigmatic new resident—an elderly man bearing his name and visage—takes up residence. The building stands silent, its secrets intact, as it draws another soul into its timeless cycle of reflection and renewal. The stakes are set in this perpetual loop of identity and redemption, with each carpenter's journey echoing the haunting question: can one truly change the past, or merely become its prisoner?"
